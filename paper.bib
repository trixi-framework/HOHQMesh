@article{Martire:2021xt,
	abstract = {{We introduce SPECFEM2D-DG, an open-source, time-domain, hybrid Galerkin software modelling the propagation of seismic and acoustic waves in coupled solid--fluid systems. For the solid part, the visco-elastic system from the routinely used SPECFEM2D software is used to simulate linear seismic waves subject to attenuation. For the fluid part, SPECFEM2D-DG includes two extensions to the acoustic part of SPECFEM2D, both relying on the Navier--Stokes equations to model high-frequency acoustics, infrasound and gravity waves in complex atmospheres. The first fluid extension, SPECFEM2D-DG-FNS, was introduced in 2017 by Brissaud, Martin, Garcia, and Komatitsch; it features a nonlinear Full Navier--Stokes (FNS) approach discretized with a discontinuous Galerkin numerical scheme. In this contribution, we focus only on introducing a second fluid extension, SPECFEM2D-DG-LNS, based on the same numerical method but rather relying on the Linear Navier--Stokes (LNS) equations. The three main modules of SPECFEM2D-DG all use the spectral element method (SEM). For both fluid extensions (FNS and LNS), two-way mechanical coupling conditions preserve the Riemann problem solution at the fluid--solid interface. Absorbing outer boundary conditions (ABCs) derived from the perfectly matched layers' approach is proposed for the LNS extension. The SEM approach supports complex topographies and unstructured meshes. The LNS equations allow the use of range-dependent atmospheric models, known to be crucial for the propagation of infrasound at regional scales. The LNS extension is verified using the method of manufactured solutions, and convergence is numerically characterized. The mechanical coupling conditions at the fluid--solid interface (between the LNS and elastodynamics systems of equations) are verified against theoretical reflection-transmission coefficients. The ABCs in the LNS extension are tested and prove to yield satisfactory energy dissipation. In an example case study, we model infrasonic waves caused by quakes occurring under various topographies; we characterize the acoustic scattering conditions as well as the apparent acoustic radiation pattern. Finally, we discuss the example case and conclude by describing the capabilities of this software. SPECFEM2D-DG is open-source and is freely available online on GitHub.}},

@article{Sherwin:2002vx,
	abstract = {Abstract The ability to construct suitable computational meshes is currently a significant limiting factor in the development of compact high-order algorithms in very complex geometries. Compact high-order algorithms such as spectral element or p-type finite element techniques offer the potential of high accuracy if the solution is smooth and a well-behaved mapping exists between the local sub-domains and a standard region. In this paper we address the problem of coupling high-order algorithms with unstructured mesh generation and CAD representation techniques. We present three complementary strategies to alleviate the problem of generation of elemental regions with singular elemental mappings. The first strategy investigates the influence of an anisometric parametric surface representation on the quality of high-order unstructured meshes. We show that a straightforward splitting of a standard linear mesh for use in a high-order method can lead to the generation of distorted, possibly invalid, meshes even for simple computational domains such as cubes. The second strategy uses hybrid meshes applying prismatic elements near curvilinear boundaries. In the third and final strategy we investigate the use of curvature driven surface discretization to incorporate higher-order information about the surface into the mesh generation. Using the computational reconstruction of the arterial bypass graft as an example computational domain we demonstrate how the combination of all three strategies leads to a valid high-order discretization of the computational domain.

@article{CANTWELL2015205,
	abstract = {Nektar++ is an open-source software framework designed to support the development of high-performance scalable solvers for partial differential equations using the spectral/hp element method. High-order methods are gaining prominence in several engineering and biomedical applications due to their improved accuracy over low-order techniques at reduced computational cost for a given number of degrees of freedom. However, their proliferation is often limited by their complexity, which makes these methods challenging to implement and use. Nektar++ is an initiative to overcome this limitation by encapsulating the mathematical complexities of the underlying method within an efficient C++ framework, making the techniques more accessible to the broader scientific and industrial communities. The software supports a variety of discretisation techniques and implementation strategies, supporting methods research as well as application-focused computation, and the multi-layered structure of the framework allows the user to embrace as much or as little of the complexity as they need. The libraries capture the mathematical constructs of spectral/hp element methods, while the associated collection of pre-written PDE solvers provides out-of-the-box application-level functionality and a template for users who wish to develop solutions for addressing questions in their own scientific domains.

Transport of a scalar quantity may be included. The analyst has a choice of Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate systems. Domain geometries and solutions may be two-dimensional with spectral element decomposition of arbitrary planar shapes, or made three-dimensional by extrusion along a spatially homogeneous direction in which Fourier expansions are employed. For three-dimensional solutions, MPI may be used to support parallel execution. Various body forces, including Boussinesq buoyancy and Coriolis terms may be added to the momentum equation to simulate e.g. the effects of stratification and thermal expansion or reference frame rotation. Parallel decomposition is performed in the Fourier dimension only, and two-dimensional elliptic systems in the plane are solved for the spectral element discretisation using direct (Cholesky) or iterative (conjugate-gradient) methods. Semtex includes a suite of additional tools for generating initial conditions and model configurations, for post processing and for analysis of model output.

	abstract = {High order (HO) schemes are attractive candidates for the numerical solution of multiscale problems occurring in fluid dynamics and related disciplines. Among the HO discretization variants, discontinuous Galerkin schemes offer a collection of advantageous features which have lead to a strong increase in interest in them and related formulations in the last decade. The methods have matured sufficiently to be of practical use for a range of problems, for example in direct numerical and large eddy simulation of turbulence. However, in order to take full advantage of the potential benefits of these methods, all steps in the simulation chain must be designed and executed with HO in mind. Especially in this area, many commercially available closed-source solutions fall short. In this work, we therefore present the FLEXI framework, a HO consistent, open-source simulation tool chain for solving the compressible Navier--Stokes equations on CPU clusters. We describe the numerical algorithms and implementation details and give an overview of the features and capabilities of all parts of the framework. Beyond these technical details, we also discuss the important but often overlooked issues of code stability, reproducibility and user-friendliness. The benefits gained by developing an open-source framework are discussed, with a particular focus on usability for the open-source community. We close with sample applications that demonstrate the wide range of use cases and the expandability of FLEXI and an overview of current and future developments.},

Nature of problem: Image 1 is a high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework, capable of solving a variety of flow applications, including compressible flows (with or without shocks), incompressible flows, various RANS and LES turbulence models, particle dynamics, multiphase flows, and aeroacoustics. Solution method: high-order discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element (DGSEM) and explicit/implicit time-steppers. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Image 1 is a multiphysics environment where the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, the Cahn--Hilliard equation and entropy--stable variants are solved. Arbitrary high--order, p--anisotropic discretisations are used, including static and dynamic p--adaptation methods (feature-based and truncation error-based). Explicit and implicit time-steppers for steady and time-marching solutions are available, including efficient multigrid and preconditioners. Numerical and analytical Jacobian computations with a colouring algorithm have been implemented. Multiphase flows are solved using a diffuse interface model: Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard. Turbulent models implemented include RANS: Spalart-Allmaras and LES: Smagorinsky, Wale, Vreman; including wall models. Immersed boundary methods can be used, to avoid creating body fitted meshes. Acoustic propagation can be computed using Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings models. Image 1 supports curvilinear, hexahedral, conforming meshes in GMSH, HDF5 and SpecMesh/HOHQMesh format.

	abstract = { We derive an implicit-explicit (IMEX) formalism for the three-dimensional (3D) Euler equations that allow a unified representation of various nonhydrostatic flow regimes, including cloud resolving and mesoscale (flow in a 3D Cartesian domain) as well as global regimes (flow in spherical geometries). This general IMEX formalism admits numerous types of methods including single-stage multistep methods (e.g., Adams methods and backward difference formulas) and multistage single-step methods (e.g., additive Runge--Kutta methods). The significance of this result is that it allows a numerical model to reuse the same machinery for all classes of time-integration methods described in this work. We also derive two classes of IMEX methods, one-dimensional and 3D, and show that they achieve their expected theoretical rates of convergence regardless of the geometry (e.g., 3D box or sphere) and introduce a new second-order IMEX Runge--Kutta method that performs better than the other second-order methods considered. We then compare all the IMEX methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency for two types of geophysical fluid dynamics problems: buoyant convection and inertia-gravity waves. These results show that the high-order time-integration methods yield better efficiency particularly when high levels of accuracy are desired. },
