README-Examples

Sixteen two-dimensional and ten three dimensional examples are included in the repository both for the user to run and to visualize models and meshes that use the features of HOHQMesh, and for developers to note visualize changes as algorithms are added or changed.

The mesh files and plot files generated by HOHQMesh can get large. For this reason, we have reduced the storage requirements in two ways:

1. Plot files for example meshes that have a counterpart in the Benchmark suite are located in the Benchmarks directory: HOHQMesh/Benchmarks/PlotFiles. Those that do not have a counterpart have plot file examples in this directory.

2. Plot files are saved using only the "skeleton" option. For more detailed plots with the internal spectral element information, users should replace the "skeleton" plot file option with the "sem" option and generate the meshes locally.

3. Example and Benchmark mesh files are not included in the repository. Again, users should generate them locally as desired.

The plot files for the following examples are found in `HOHQMesh/Benchmarks/PlotFiles/Benchmarks`
