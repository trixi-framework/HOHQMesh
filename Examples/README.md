# HOHQMesh Examples

There are nineteen two-dimensional and ten three-dimensional examples included in the repository
both for the user to run and to visualize models and meshes that use the features of HOHQMesh,
and for developers to compare changes as algorithms are added or changed.

The mesh files and plot files generated by HOHQMesh can get large.
For this reason, we have reduced the storage requirements in the following ways:

1. Plot files for example meshes that have a counterpart in the Benchmark suite are located
   in the Benchmarks directory. That is, the plot files for the following examples are
   found in `HOHQMesh/Benchmarks/PlotFiles/Benchmarks`:

   - AllFeatures
   - BoneAndMarrow
   - BottomFromFile
   - Box3D
   - Box3DRotated
   - Circles3
   - GingerbreadMan
   - HalfCircleArc
   - HalfCircleExtruded
   - HalfCircleRotated
   - Malpasset
   - NACA0012
   - PacMan
   - Pill
   - Pond3D
   - RotatedEllipseWithSubregions
   - SplineGeometry

   Those that do not have a counterpart have plot file examples in this directory.

2. Plot files are saved using only the "skeleton" option. For more detailed plots with the internal
   spectral element information, users should replace the "skeleton" plot file option with
   the "sem" option and generate the meshes locally. Two plot files with the "sem" output option are
   provided in the Benchmark suite, specifically the two-dimensional `BoneAndMarrow` example
   and three-dimensional `Box3D` example.

   Note, due to file size, no plot file of any kind is provided for `Examples/3D/MtStHelens`. A user would need to generate the files for this large mesh locally.

3. Example and Benchmark mesh files are **not** included in the repository.
   Again, users should generate them locally as desired.

## Overview of 3D Examples

The table below provides a short summary of each 3D example. The 3D meshes use features from
the 2D mesh generation as well as an extrusion procedure. For instance, examples that extrude
from a bottom topography use either a parametric equation or a bi-cubic spline interpolation.
See the [Three Dimensional Hexahedral Meshes](https://trixi-framework.github.io/HOHQMesh/three-dimensional-hexahedral-meshes/#simple-extrusion)
section of the HOHQMesh documentation for more details.

For brevity, the table only provides a description and the extrusion algorithm used in each
control file.
