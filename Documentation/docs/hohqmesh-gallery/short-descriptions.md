# "Useful" 2D meshes

- cavity-ramp: Highlights that the spectral element mesh has big elements
- cylinder-flow: Obstacle with a wake region
- embedded-boundaries: Internal boundaries aligned
- naca0012: Standard airfoil and mesh is nearly symmetric
- naca6412: Another airfoil with an 11 degree angle of attack. Original data taken from https://github.com/cfsengineering/GMSH-Airfoil-2D
- three-element-30p30n: Three element airfoil with many sharp features to capture. I got the data from this site http://www.ae.metu.edu.tr/tuncer/ae546/multi/ but there are many AIAA papers that use this geometry
- lake-superior: Coastline data
- east-coast-us: Coastline data and many scales
- malpasset: Multiscale and coastline data. Far fewer elements than the FEM counterpart
- indian-ocean: Multiple scales and boundaries captured

# Extruded 3D meshes with bottom data
- east-coast-us-3d: Extrusion from given bathymetry data with a sea shelf
- mt-st-helens: Automatic sizing with topography data, two figures neither of which I am 100% happy with
